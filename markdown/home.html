<p>"Communism is for us not a state of affairs which is to be established, an ideal to which reality [will] have to adjust itself. We call communism the real movement which abolishes the present state of things. The conditions of this movement result from the premises now in existence." <em>Karl Marx - 'The German Ideology' (1845)</em></p>
<p>"Thousands upon thousands of martyrs have heroically laid down their lives for the people; let us hold their banner high and march ahead along the path crimson with their blood!" <em>Mao Zedong - 'On Coalition Government' (April 24, 1945), Selected Works, Vol. III, p. 264.</em></p>
<p>"Struggle exposes us to the simple form of failure (the assault did not succeed), while victory exposes us to its most redoubtable form: we notice that we have won in vain, and that our victory paves the way for repetition and restoration. That, for the state, a revolution is never anything more than an intervening period. Hence the sacrificial temptations of nothingness. For a politics of emancipation, the enemy that is to be feared most is not repression at the hands of the established order. It is the interiority of nihilism, and the unbounded cruelty that can come with its emptiness." <em>Alain Badiou - 'The Communist Hypothesis' (August 1, 2010), p. 32</em></p>
